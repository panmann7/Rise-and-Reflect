A full stack web journalling app called Rise & Reflect, where users can create, update, and delete journal entries. I decided to make this app because in the mornings I like to reflect and plan out my day and goals - this is a great way for me to store all my journals. 

One thing I've very proud of in this project is implementing the back-end. Azure and SQL server were very frustrating and had many bugs, and it felt very satisfying at the end when it all came together. 

Features I've implemented:

Frontend:
React using Typescript
Styling using MUI
Visually appealing and responsive UI
Using react router
Git usage

Backend:
Built using C# using .NET8
Using Microsoft Entity Framework Core
Using a MySQL database
Has the CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete

Advanced features:
The switching of theme from light to dark
Containerized project using docker
Deployed using Azure
